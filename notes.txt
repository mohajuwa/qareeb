Analyze the project in your base knowledge and do the following :

first thing write a prompt about the following 

1 - I need you to Replace Fluttertoast with something modern that will display the app icon with the notification
   with error things or info or success etc..

2 - see the logic of when request a ride with using this ("Automatically book the nearest driver for (${globalcurrency}${amountcontroller.text})")
 and when not using it , couse when I turn on the switch the request sends of and the driver response with accept and everything is fine
 but , when I am not using it , the requist send ok and the driver response with custom price the response till now is fine in customer app
 thin saddinley I do not get the same as it should when I try to accept or reject his response , see and you will understand..

 3 - when I start or get back or refresh the  MapScreen (main screen in app) the app loading like leazy , I mean see
   and keep in mind that I need it to work with the same logic , if you can re structure the code to make it run faster as posibble
   thin go ahead .


4 - see where we need to use SingleChildScrollView to make the app style better with zero pixels errors..
