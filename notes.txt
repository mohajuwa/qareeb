analyze the project , map_screen_original.dart take it as a refrence for what you should do to make map_screen.dart
get the same feture ..
the promblims I noteced that the vehicles not displaing the default category , and when changing the vehicle the price should change to fit with..


and here is some of what I noticed , and you should notice better that me ..

Problem 1: Vehicles Stacking Up Instead of Switching
When you select a different vehicle type (like switching from "Car" to "Motorcycle"), the old car markers stay on the map AND the new motorcycle markers get added on top. So you end up seeing ALL types of vehicles at once instead of just the category you selected. It's like having multiple layers of stickers on your map that never get removed.
Problem 2: Vehicles Disappear After Selecting Drop Location
When you first open the app, you can see vehicle markers on the map just fine. But as soon as you select both pickup and drop locations, all the vehicle markers vanish! This is really frustrating because you want to see available drivers near your route, not have them disappear right when you need them most.
Problem 3: Missing Trip Calculation Display
In your original working version, when you select pickup and drop points, you probably see a nice panel showing:

Distance: "5.2 km"
Duration: "12 minutes"
Estimated fare: "15 YRE"
Price range: "12 YRE - YRE 18"

But in the current version, this calculation panel is either missing completely or not showing the right information. Users need to see this before booking!
Problem 4: Button Shows Loading Forever
When you tap the "Calculate Price" or "Find Driver" button, it shows a loading spinner but never actually completes. It just keeps spinning indefinitely instead of showing you the calculated price and letting you proceed to book.
What Should Happen Instead:

Vehicle Switching: When you tap "Motorcycle", all car markers should disappear and only motorcycle markers should show
Persistent Vehicles: After selecting pickup/drop, vehicles should STAY visible on the map
Clear Calculations: Should show a nice panel with distance, time, and price estimates
